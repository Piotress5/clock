## General Information
Combined into one greater project, Clock is an application which allows to check your local time, measure some intervals (maybe your reflex too) or do some countdowns. All apps and both of provided clock modes - digital and analog - are customizable too. To make things even more cozy, you can add your own background and music!


## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript ES6


## Features
#### List of the ready features:
- Page is by default turning between two modes: Non-Fullscreen and Fullscreen, they can be turned on and off or delayed,
- Fullscreen mode shows only currently active application,
- Non-Fullscreen mode allows user to toggle between apps, change settings and customize site's elements,
- There are 3 in-build applications: clock with two display modes (digital and analog), stopwatch and timer.

#### Additional info:
- Timer plays sound after ending countdown - you can adjust its volume or change to any other you want,
- Music is set to 0, but increasing its value makes it play until stopped or changed to other uploaded track, (READ DISCLAIMER)


## Setup

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_.


### !!! DISCLAIMER !!!
Although page have option to play music in background, the one provided and playing by default is NOT MINE. I do not own it in any terms and all credits go to its owner: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVCQxvytJoc&ab_channel=AK. It's only for this project purposes and I'm not willing to steal anyone's property. 


## Room for Improvement
Not really much that I'm expecting, but maybe adding more options to current personalization possibilities.

Room for improvement:
- No plans for now.

To do:
- More customization options (new fonts, other backgrounds)
